Leitrim is also known as the 'Wild Rose County', which inspired this design. Please note that as each piece is individually handcrafted, the piece you receive may differ slightly from the image shown here. Firstly, the bottom half of the outside of the bowl is dipped in cream slip. A winding rose stem is then carved into the surface, with slip dots added along the stem. Each slip dot is carved into a delicate rose, with green slip leaves added for a touch of color. The combination of the smooth glaze and the sgraffito decoration, which means 'to scratch', results in delicate raised lines. The decoration can be felt by running fingers over it, adding a tactile element to the experience of using the small rose bowl. Dimensions: Approx 19cm x 6cm",
